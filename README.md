# WiiCon Remote

> A wireless motion controller for creative applications, inspired by the Wii Remote.

**⚠️ This project is under active development as part of an academic project.**

## Overview

WiiCon is an open-source, network-connected motion controller built around the ESP32 microcontroller and a BMI160 6-axis IMU (accelerometer + gyroscope). It streams orientation and motion data over the network using the **OSC (Open Sound Control)** protocol, making it ideal for:

- Interactive art installations
- Music and sound design (gesture-controlled synthesis)
- Creative coding (Processing, TouchDesigner, Pure Data)
- Motion capture prototyping
- Game development and research

## Features

### Implemented

- **BMI160 IMU Driver** — Direct I2C communication with the Bosch BMI160 sensor
- **Madgwick AHRS Filter** — Real-time orientation estimation (roll, pitch, yaw)
- **Automatic Calibration** — Gyroscope and accelerometer biases calibration on startup
- **Configurable Axis Mapping** — Remap and invert sensor axes as needed
- **Serial Output** — CSV format for debugging and visualization

### Planned

- [x] Network Manager (captive portal for WiFi configuration)
- [x] OSC data transmission over WiFi
- [ ] Raw and filtered data modes
- [ ] Button inputs
<!-- - [ ] Battery monitoring -->
- [x] LED status indicators
- [x] Low-latency optimizations

## Configuration

All user-adjustable settings are in `config.h`:

```cpp
// I2C Pins
const int SDA_PIN = 2;
const int SCL_PIN = 1;

// BMI160 I2C Address (0x68 or 0x69)
const uint8_t BMI160_ADDR = 0x68;

// Serial baud rate
const uint32_t SERIAL_BAUD = 115200;

// Calibration samples
const int CALIB_SAMPLES = 200;
```

## OSC Protocol (Planned)

The device will transmit sensor data via OSC over UDP
